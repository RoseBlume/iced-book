While the book is being worked on, the best resources to get started with iced are:

- A [step-by-step video guide to building a simple text editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcBJ7cPSALo)
- The [API Reference](https://docs.iced.rs/iced/)
- The [official examples](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples)

# Introduction
[iced] is a cross-platform GUI library for [Rust]. It is inspired by [Elm], a delightful functional language for building web applications.

As a GUI library, iced helps you build *[graphical user interfaces]* for your Rust applications.

iced is strongly focused on **simplicity** and **type-safety**. As a result, iced tries to provide simple building blocks that can be put together with strong typing to reduce the chance of **runtime errors**.

This book will:

- Introduce you to the fundamental ideas of iced.
- Teach you how to build interactive applications with iced.
- Emphasize principles to scale and grow iced applications.

Before proceeding, you should have some basic familiarity with Rust. If you are new to Rust or feel lost at some point, I recommend you to read [the official Rust book].
