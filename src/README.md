# Introduction

**Warning: This book, like [iced] itself, is not yet complete and is a work in progress.  In the mean time please refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/) and look at the included [examples](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples) to learn more about iced.**

If you want to help contribute then [pull requests](https://github.com/iced-rs/book) for this book are welcome.

## Overview

[iced] is a cross-platform GUI library for [Rust]. It is inspired by [Elm], a delightful functional language for building web applications.

As a GUI library, iced helps you build *[graphical user interfaces]* for your Rust applications.

iced is strongly focused on **simplicity** and **type-safety**. As a result, iced tries to provide simple building blocks than can be put together with strong typing to reduce the chance of **runtime errors**.

This book will:

- Introduce you to the fundamental ideas of iced.
- Teach you how to build interactive applications with iced.
- Emphasize principles to scale and grow iced applications.

Before proceeding, you should have some basic familiarity with Rust. If you are new to Rust or feel lost at some point, I recommend you to read [the official Rust book].
